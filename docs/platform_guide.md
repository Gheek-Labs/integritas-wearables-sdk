# Platform Guide

## Wear OS (Android)

### Requirements
- Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- Python environment (e.g., Chaquopy, BeeWare)
- Network connectivity (Wi-Fi or cellular)

### Optimizations
- **Network Detection**: Automatically checks Android connectivity manager
- **Memory Management**: Reduced HTTP connection pool (1 connection, 2 max)
- **Power Efficiency**: Lower priority background thread
- **UI Thread Safety**: Safe to call from main thread

### Example Setup (Chaquopy)
```python
# In your Android activity
from com.chaquo.python import Python
Python.start(AndroidPlatform(context))
```

### Limitations
- Background processing limited by Android battery optimization
- May require user permission for background network access

## watchOS (iOS)

### Requirements
- watchOS 6.0 or higher
- Python environment (e.g., Pyto, Carnets)
- Paired iPhone for network connectivity (unless cellular model)

### Optimizations
- **Background Tasks**: Uses iOS background task APIs
- **Memory Efficiency**: Garbage collection disabled during critical operations
- **Battery Life**: Lower thread priority and efficient processing
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for continuous sensor monitoring

### Example Setup (Pyto)
```python
# Pyto automatically handles iOS integration
# No special setup required
```

### Limitations
- Background processing time limited by iOS (typically 30 seconds)
- Network connectivity depends on paired iPhone (non-cellular models)
- Memory constraints more severe than Android

## Tizen (Samsung Galaxy Watch)

### Requirements
- Tizen 5.5 or higher
- Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 or newer
- Python runtime for Tizen

### Optimizations
- **Power Management**: CPU wake lock requests during processing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Platform-specific memory optimizations
- **Resource Awareness**: Respects Tizen resource constraints

### Example Setup
```python
# Tizen Python environment handles platform integration
# Import Tizen-specific modules if needed
try:
    import tizen
except ImportError:
    pass  # Fallback for non-Tizen platforms
```

### Limitations
- Limited Python ecosystem on Tizen
- May require Samsung-specific permissions
- Background processing subject to Tizen power management

## Cross-Platform Best Practices

### 1. Handle Intermittent Connectivity
```python
# The SDK handles this automatically, but you can check status
status = sdk.get_status()
if status['pending_requests'] > 50:
    print("High queue backlog - consider reducing sampling rate")
```

### 2. Respect Memory Constraints
```python
# Keep metadata small (<1KB)
metadata = {
    "unit": "bpm",
    "location": "wrist"
    # Avoid large arrays or complex nested structures
}
```

### 3. Optimize Sampling Rates
```python
# High-frequency sampling may overwhelm the queue
# Consider aggregating data before recording
if time_since_last_reading > 1.0:  # 1 Hz max
    sdk.record_sensor_data("heart_rate", current_hr)
```

### 4. Handle Platform-Specific Errors
```python
try:
    sdk.record_sensor_data("sensor", value)
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "queue full" in str(e):
        # Reduce sampling rate or implement data aggregation
        pass
```

### 5. Battery Life Considerations
- Use lower sampling rates when possible
- Batch multiple sensor readings into single records when appropriate
- Implement sleep modes during inactive periods
- Monitor `get_status()` to detect resource pressure

## Testing Across Platforms

### Emulator Testing
- **Wear OS**: Android Studio Wear OS emulator
- **watchOS**: Xcode watchOS simulator (limited Python support)
- **Tizen**: Tizen Studio emulator

### Physical Device Testing
Always test on physical devices as emulators may not accurately reflect:
- Battery consumption
- Memory constraints  
- Network connectivity behavior
- Sensor accuracy and timing

## Deployment Considerations

### App Store Requirements
- **Google Play**: Comply with wearable app guidelines
- **App Store**: Meet watchOS app requirements
- **Galaxy Store**: Follow Tizen app submission guidelines

### Privacy and Permissions
- Declare network permissions in app manifest
- Handle user consent for data collection
- Implement data minimization principles
- Provide clear privacy policy

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor these metrics in production:
- Queue backlog (`pending_requests`)
- Processing success rate
- Battery consumption impact
- Memory usage patterns
